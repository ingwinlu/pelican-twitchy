pelican-twitchy
===================

pelican-twitchy is a bootstrap3 based pelican theme, with a static navbar on the left which is toggable to provide more space for content. Parts of it has been taken from the great [pelican-bootstrap3](https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3) by [DandyDev](http://dandydev.net/), so credit where credit is due to all contributors of pelican-bootstrap3!

It is still in early development, though it already provides more then just basic functionality and is usable.
